  "title": "Buidl the Buidlers: How You Can Create the Next Generation of Web3 Contributors through Education, Peer Review, and Professional Development",
  "description": "We all know there are not enough qualified people in the world to fill all the roles Web3 is asking for. We’ve got to *create* those people! Join our workshop to learn ways for developing good contributors. We’ll start with an open office session where you can ask us your most burning questions. Then we’ll move into workstations where you can get 1on1 guidance on specific aspects of Web3 talent building. This means web2 to web3 conversion AND sharpening contributors who are already web3 native.",
