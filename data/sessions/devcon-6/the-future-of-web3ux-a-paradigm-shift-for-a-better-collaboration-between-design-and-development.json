  "description": "70% of UX design on Ethereum is defined within the Smart Contracts. So why are so few UX experts involved in Smart Contract design? Itâ€™s time for a shift towards better crypto UX. The future of a better web3 UX will rely heavily on a paradigm shift. The necessity of change in the way we work and the way we look at how products are designed and planned is more and more needed.
