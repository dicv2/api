  "description": "Launched Feb 2020, RAI—a fork of DAI—is an ETH backed stable-ish coin that uses an onchain PI controller to set interest rates automatically and emphasizes “ungovernance”. If you’ve ever looked at a central bank and thought about replacing it with a computer, this talk is for you!
