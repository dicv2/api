  "description": "If Ethereum is a digital nation, millions of Africans will flock in masses to become citizens. Why? A fair chance to participate in an open borderless economy, and ultimately self-determination. Web3 is unleashing a generation of African talent trapped within the confines of the old gated economy. A new narrative places Africa differently through the Web3 lens. Why should Ethereum builders take African talent and markets seriously? Where are low hanging fruits for win-win scenarios?",
