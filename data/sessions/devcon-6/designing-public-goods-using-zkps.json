  "title": "Designing Public Goods Using ZKPs",
  "description": "In this talk, designers reflect on the common threads that run through a constellation of tools and applications built with ZKPs. We share mental models being explored and strategies for fluidly navigating an evolving space. By offering real examples from our design workshops and dApps, we will explore the question â€“ How might we materialize abstract concepts to enable internal and external teams to build with ZKPs?",
