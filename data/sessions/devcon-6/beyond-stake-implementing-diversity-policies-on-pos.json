  "title": "Beyond Stake: Implementing Diversity Policies on PoS",
  "description": "We look at the challenges of implementing various diversity-improving policies on a PoS network. Economic (dis)incentivization is a popular approach, but can be undermined by non-standard miner economics such as (cross-domain) MEV or derivatives on incentivization. As an alternative, we outline an approach to include diversity support into the consensus level without requiring changing the basic functionality of the protocol by adapting the concept of general adversary structures.",
