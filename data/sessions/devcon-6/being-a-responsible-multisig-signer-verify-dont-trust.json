  "description": "So you have been trusted with safeguarding a project along with other members of your community, congratulations! But, alas, the first transaction from a developer on the team comes in. How do you proceed? Can you blindly trust the developer? Should you? It's tempting to just see what other multisig members do and roll along, right? In this talk we'll go over what you can do to verify what a transaction will actually do, and what tools you have at your disposal for this. No coding required!",
