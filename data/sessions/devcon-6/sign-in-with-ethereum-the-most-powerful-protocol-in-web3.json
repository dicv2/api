  "title": "Sign in With Ethereum: the Most Powerful Protocol in #Web3?",
  "description": "Sign in with Ethereum is an almost accidental byproduct of #Web3, but is already turning into an incredibly powerful tool for user engagement and convenience.

Join Lang Cui (Struck Capital), Nick Johnson (ENS) Justina PetraitytÄ— (3boxx) & Shiv Malik (Pool Data)",
