  "title": "The History and Future of Decentralized Operations at MakerDAO",
  "description": "MakerDAO is one of the foundational projects in Ethereum that originally created DeFi, and the creator of the DAI stablecoin. The project has a rich history of gradual decentralization and, today, is one of the largest and most advanced DAOs in the space. In this talk I will outline the evolution of decentralized operations and governance at MakerDAO. We will have a look at a few of the most recent scaling challenges, how they developed, and how MakerDAO is dealing with them.",
