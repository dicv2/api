  "description": "\"The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily use... established by custom.\"  At KERNEL, we've spent 2 years establishing customs which embody regenerative ways of living, both internally and in web3 projects.  We'd welcome sharing KERNEL customs in an interactive workshop, where we get to know each other & our commons through 4 words: trust, value, freedom, and giving.",
