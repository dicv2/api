  "title": "Hybrid PBS from CL's Perspective",
  "description": "The talk seeks to address the following questions: - Why does PBS matter from CL's point of view? What happens if we completely ignore it on the protocol layer? What if we wait to release it? - How did we implement hybrid PBS on CL clients from history to functional products? - What do they look like in code? - What are the gotchas and the trade-offs? - What are the remaining questions we shall seek before moving to full PBS?",
