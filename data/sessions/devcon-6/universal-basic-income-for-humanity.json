  "description": "On 2021 the Proof of Humanity protocol was released alongside the UBI token reaching almost 20k humans receiving Universal Basic Income. This talk will offer direct testimonials from users on how UBI has impacted their lives. We will demo how Proof of Humanity v2 will support the use of Soul Bound Tokens and reduce costs using Layer 2. Also we will explain how UBI v2 extends its streaming features allowing real time money and how we can create regenerative economics for it as a community.",
