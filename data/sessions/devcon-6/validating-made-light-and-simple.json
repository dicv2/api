  "description": "The network has seen an increase in staked Eth led by staking pools, liquid staking protocols, CEX and solo stakers. The complexity of running multiple clients (Execution, Consensus, Beacon and possibly MEV) means that validating is increasingly considered an organised activity for teams of specialists.  Nimbus is pushing for simplification to ensure it remains accessible to individuals and institutions alike. In this talk, Nimbus presents its vision for the future of Ethereum client experience",
