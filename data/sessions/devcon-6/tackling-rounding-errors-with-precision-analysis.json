  "title": "Tackling Rounding Errors with Precision Analysis",
  "description": "Rounding errors in smart contracts can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. In this talk, we'll motivate the importance of rigorous numerical analysis through real-world exploits, and review existing precision analysis techniques. We'll then argue for the development of automated error propagation analysis tools to overcome the tediousness of manual efforts.",
