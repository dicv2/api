  "description": "This is a workshop discussion about the EVM. Anyone can come up and pitch their favourite EVM-first EIPs.\nWe want to be a bit more unconventional and would like to transform the room into a \"live voting space\" where attendees can fight for their favourite new EVM feature.\nDifferent proposals will be listed and discussed for 3-5 minutes each, where invited panelists give a short opinion followed by loud interaction from the audience.",
