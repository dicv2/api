  "title": "Nosy Neighbor - Automated Fuzz Harness Generation for Golang Projects",
  "description": "Nosy Neighbor was developed as a breadth-first fuzzing tool for the critical golang clients in the ethereum network - Prysm, Go-Ethereum, and Mev-Boost. Nosy is a very annoying (to the devs) tool that aims to find bugs the moment they are introduced. Leveraging the go/types and go/parser libraries used by the Go compiler, Nosy analyzes the AST of a repo and generates fuzz harnesses for continuous fuzzing Come learn about Nosy's novel approach to go-fuzzing and the issues it has uncovered!",
