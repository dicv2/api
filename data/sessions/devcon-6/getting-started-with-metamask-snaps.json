  "description": "[MetaMask Snaps](https://bit.ly/3u8bDKh) is the next phase in [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)'s evolution. First previewed at Devcon V in 2019, we are now focused on growing the Snaps platform and ecosystem, and new features are added every month. In this workshop, you'll build a Snap from start to finish with the MetaMask Snaps dev team. In the process, you'll learn about all the features you can make use of for Ethereum, Layer 2's, zero knowledge cryptography, and beyond.",
