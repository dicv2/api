  "description": "Tokens are a unique way to generate Brand – Users connections.  There is a world in terms of what users can do with tokens, and leading Brands such as La Praire, Hugo Boss are already exploring this world with us. Connections are the key. We have realized that the value of the token comes from connections, together with goods and services. It’s clear for us now that tokens are the integration point for web3 and token technology should be built around this concept.",
