How to prove that you donated to Gitcoin grants or that you voted for a specific DAO proposal without giving out your Ethereum address? 

You can prove - in a SNARK - that you own an Ethereum account part of a group (e.g Gitcoin donors or DAO voters) and receive a ZK Badge!

Built as a new primitive, ZK Badges are a reputation and access control tool used by on-chain (e.g governances) and off-chain apps.

They enable users to fully leverage their on-chain data, with privacy.
